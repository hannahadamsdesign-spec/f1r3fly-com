## HOMEPAGE (index.html)

### Hero Section
**Eyebrow Text (gradient label):** "Concurrent Computing — A Paradigm Shift"
**Main Heading:** "F1R3FLY: A Digital Evolution"
**Keywords (large display text):** Scalable | Searchable | Secure | Storable
**Description Paragraph:**
F1R3FLY ('Firefly') enables real concurrent computing • For the first time, this makes the world's best data security system fast, cost effective, and universally usable • It makes possible huge increases in data center processing throughput, which means fewer massively expensive and environment-challenging new data centers will be needed • It introduces a new and massively powerful data indexing and search system with huge benefits – for example in medical research and other areas • It can test any program code for correct construction and reports the effects of running the code, a significant protection against hacking

**CTA Button:** "Challenge The Computing Norms" → links to consensus-chain-security.html

### Content Section 1
**Label (gradient text, NOT button):** "Insatiable Demands for more Data Centers"
**Heading:** [Based on context, likely similar to what's on live site]
**Body Copy:**
Many governments and industry leaders are planning for more and bigger data centers with ever increasing energy usage. They believe this is where the steadily growing demand for Data and AI services is leading. Much of this is unnecessary. Introducing concurrent computing into data centers enables dramatically higher processing throughput even on standard processors. But if the data center is equipped with new generation processors, the increase in throughput can be massively greater. These data centers will be able to provide vastly more capacity within their same footprint and sell the considerable freed-up capacity instead of laying out a fortune unnecessarily on completely new data center capacity.

---

### Content Section 2
**Label (gradient text, NOT button):** "Taking the Fight To The Hackers"
**Heading:** "Enterprise-Wide Consensus Chain Security"
**Body Copy:**
The threat of hacking grows annually. Existing cyber-security systems are failing to keep up. For the past twenty years there has been a security system that has never been successfully hacked, but it has been much too slow and expensive for general use. F1R3FLY's concurrent computing for the first time makes this system tens of thousands of times faster for a fraction of the cost. It is at last the practical real solution for all enterprise data systems.

---

### Content Section 3
**Label (gradient text, NOT button):** "High Density Forensic Search Capability"
**Heading:** "Search Billions of Records in Seconds"
**Body Copy:**
F1R3FLY introduces MORK, a new extremely powerful indexing and search system. MORK indexes data by an unprecedentedly wide range of data types and can search billions of records in seconds. It has a very wide range of applications, from identifying deep trends in crypto transaction histories to searching vast arrays of data for medical research.

---

### Content Section 4
**Label (gradient text, NOT button):** "Code Accuracy Guarantees"
**Heading:** "Delivery of Self Testing Code"
**Body Copy:**
F1R3FLY's OSLF (Operational Semantics in Logical Form) is a tool that dynamically checks computer code, validating its program type and checking for faults and vulnerabilities. If the code is found to be safe, OSLF dry-runs it and reports on what its outcome would be. This functionality has been tested using examples of notorious hacks and software failures and has consistently identified the weaknesses that let them through.

---

### Content Section 5
**Label (gradient text, NOT button):** "Technology is On Its Steepest Growth Trajectory in Years"
**Heading:** "F1R3FLY upgrades Today's Technology for Tomorrow's Benefit"
**Body Copy:**
F1R3FLY is a significant Digital Evolution. It puts users back in control of their data. It takes the fight to the hackers, implements powerful corporate data security, provides ultra high speed forensic search and massively boosts data center capacity.

## DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS CHAIN SECURITY PAGE (consensus-chain-security.html)
*Original URL: /smart-contracts*

### Hero Section
**Label (gradient text):** "Taking The Fight To The Hackers"
**Heading:** "Distributed Consensus Chain Security"
**Description:**
The threat of hacking grows annually. Existing cyber-security systems are failing to keep up. For the past twenty years there has been a security system that has never been successfully hacked, but it has been much too slow and expensive for general use.

### Main Content
**Section Heading:** "Enterprise-Wide Protection"
**Body Copy:**
F1R3FLY's concurrent computing for the first time makes this system tens of thousands of times faster for a fraction of the cost. It is at last the practical real solution for all enterprise data systems.

The consensus chain approach ensures that every transaction, every piece of data, is verified across a distributed network. This eliminates single points of failure and makes unauthorized access virtually impossible.

**Additional Content:** [Card-based layout showing key benefits]
- **Never Hacked:** Twenty years of deployment with zero successful breaches. The underlying consensus mechanism has withstood every attack attempt.
- **10,000x Faster:** F1R3FLY's architecture enables massive parallelization, making enterprise-grade security accessible to all organizations.

## KEY STYLING NOTES

### Label/Eyebrow Text Styling
**Class:** `.label`
**Appearance:** Small, uppercase, gradient text (cyan → lime → yellow)
**NOT A BUTTON:** No background, no padding, no border-radius
**NOT A BUTTON:** No background, no padding, no border-radius
**Reference:** Like "DEVELOPERS", "CLIENTS", "PARTNERS" text on F1R3FLY.io

### Button/CTA Styling
**Class:** `.hero-cta` (hero), `.gradient-btn` (content sections), `.nav-cta` (navigation)
**Appearance:** Pill-shaped, solid gradient background, padding, hover effects
**Examples:**
- "Challenge The Computing Norms" (hero CTA - IS a button)
- "Get In Touch" (navigation CTA - IS a button)
- "Secure Your Enterprise" (content CTA - IS a button)

### Critical Issue from Screenshots
The label text "Challenge The Computing Norms" in screenshot appears to have button-like teal background styling when it should be simple gradient text. This needs investigation on deployed site.

## CONTENT GAPS TO FILL

### Pages Needing More Detail:
1. **Secure Data Sharing** - Need full content from /siloed-data-architectures
2. **Resources** - Need to extract content from /resources  
3. **Increase Throughput** - May need additional detail sections
4. **Code Validation** - May need card-based breakdown of benefits

### Next Steps:
1. Visit live site pages directly to extract exact content
2. Compare our current HTML files to this audit
3. Update any mismatches
4. Ensure label vs button styling is correct
